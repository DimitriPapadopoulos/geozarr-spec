# Readme - GeoZarr-Spec

This document aims to provides a geospatial extension to the Zarr specification (v2). Zarr specifies a protocol and format used for storing Zarr arrays, while the present extension defines **conventions** and recommendations for storing **multidimensional georeferenced grid** of geospatial observations (including rasters). 

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## Current Version



## Status

This specification is an early draft (v0.1) deveveloped in the frame of an European Space Agency (ESA) GSTP. Through the optional General Support Technology Programme (GSTP) ESA, Participating States and Industry work together to convert promising engineering concepts into a broad spectrum of useable products.
